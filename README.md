Cryptosticky"

Yellow notes (stickies) with alarm and encryption. In the process of portig to VC2015. 
Most of it works, not ready for deployment.
If you would like a working version, use the Snow Den edition from SF.

Published however to give you access to code snippets like yellow sticky display
transparency etc ... 


Written in: Visual C++;

Update coming soon.

Warning: The encryption from different Cryptosticky versions are not 
compatible with each other. Introducing Unicode and MBCS changed things
around, so please decrypt all your secrets before installing a new version.

Alternatively, you may push the old data to a different directory and 
access it with the old version.
