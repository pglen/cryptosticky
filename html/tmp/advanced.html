      <div style="text-align: left;">
      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; CryptoSticky, being a
newly developed application, is full of exciting features. The
transparency eye candy is just the tip of the iceberg. For instance,
CryptoSticky comes with a spell checker, that is 'tall dark, and silent'.
The spell checker operates while you type, and only spell&nbsp; checks
the current line. A subtle 'squiggly' underlines the word that
CryptoSticky finds out of order. The spell checker comes with a huge and
powerful suggestion facility. Right clicking on any word will deliver
an extensive but appropriate list.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Another exciting feature is the Memo sharing
feature. One can connect multiple CryptoSticky instances from different
computers onto a single shared directory. All the instances monitor the
shared directory (or folder) regularly, and if there is any change, the
appropriate action is taken. (Show/Hide/Refresh) When any user changes
a memo, all the subscribers to that folder will see the change at the
next refresh cycle. The refresh cycle can be configured to be as little
as
one minute. When CryptoSticky detects a change, a sound is played. The
user has full control over the sound's properties. It can be made as
subtle or as strong as one wishes.<br>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a
larger corporation, sub entities can have their own shared
folder. For example, one folder for the 'Sales' department, one folder
for
'Purchasing'. Alternatively, folders can be assigned to teams, or
projects, and all members of the subscribers will be kept notified as
appropriate. This version of CryptoSticky can only monitor one folder at
any one time.<br>

            <br>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
CryptoSticky keeps a log of important events. To get to the log window,
open the about dialog and click on the 'Show Log' button. The
CryptoSticky
log lists (among others) 1.) Application Startup 2.) Memo Editing
events 3.)
Alarm Related Events 4.) Memo Conflicts, 5.) Memo Deletions 6.)
Application Shutdowns. CryptoSticky logs are kept on a per machine basis
(on
local storage). The clogfile can be found at:

      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Editing conflicts.
It is possible for two people to edit
the same note. If that happens, CryptoSticky detects the situation, and
prompts the user with the conflicting memo. Both the new (edited) memo
and the old (conflicting) memo is presented to the user, allowing a
choice between the a.) old content, b.) new content, or c.)&nbsp;
manual
merging of the two contents.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deletion conflicts. Memos are not deleted, rather,
they are moved to a 'Deleted' memo path. If a user deletes a memo, it
can be retrieved from the 'Deleted' folder. Naturally, memos that are
deleted from the 'Deleted' memo path are deleted permanently.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hierearchical list of memos. Most things in nature are
arranged in a tree like structure. So are memos in CryptoSticky. There is
no end in sight to describe the flexibility of the tree structure. <br>
