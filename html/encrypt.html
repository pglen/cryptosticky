                    CryptoSticky has
                    a state of the art encryption facility. The stickies
                    are encrypted
                    in-line, where the original content is replaced by
                    the encrypted
                    content. The encrypted content is converted to
                    numbers, so the
                    cipher text stays in text form, which gives the
                    encryption
                    facility&nbsp; tremendous versatility. One can
                    encrypt text from any
                    document, paste it back, and the content is safe.
                    The plain text
                    approach is so versatile, that one can copy text
                    from any document
                    (like Word or Open Office) or from any email program
                    (like Thunder Bird), encrypt it, and
                    paste it
                    back to its original place. There is even a one
                    button or one
                    keystroke operation to
                    encrypt / decrypt&nbsp; the clipboard.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; The encryption was designed to be super
                    safe, to allow you
                    to safely store bank
                    account information, site login details, site
                    passwords, or any other sensitive
                    personal information. The encrypted information
                    cannot be seen by
                    intruders, even if your computer is compromised, as
                    the cipher text has
                    an extreme high resistance to crypt analysis. In
                    addition to that, no
                    record of the encryption keys are kept, there is
                    nothing to recover or
                    attack.<br>

                          on
                          the body of the sticky. The right click
                          context menu
                          (pictured to the right) shows, with commands
                          for encryption /
                          decryption. Clicking on the 'Encrypt Sticky'
                          command will prompt you
                          for an encryption key to be used.&nbsp; The
                          encryption key needs to be
                          entered twice, to make sure the entry is the
                          intended value. Upon
                          successful entry, the text of the sticky is
                          encrypted with that key.
                          The key is then discarded, no record of it is
                          kept in any form. Every
                          sticky can have its own unique key, or they
                          all can have the same key,
                          CryptoSticky does not enforce any key rules,
                          and has no key management.
                          This makes it extremely secure, as there is no
                          key to attack.<br>
                          <br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp; To decrypt a sticky, activate the
                          command 'Decrypt Sticky'
                          by
                          clicking on it. The same password dialog
                          appears, prompting you twice
                          for the decryption key. Upon successful key
                          entry, CryptoSticky will
                          decrypt your cipher text, and place it back
                          into its original place. If
                          the wrong key&nbsp; is entered, the decryption
                          hash will not match,
                          CryptoSticky
                          cannot decrypt the text, and will leave it
                          untouched. There are no
                          limits imposed on the number of
                          tries.&nbsp; One can encrypt the text of the
                          sticky multiple times,
                          there is
                          no facility to check for double encryption.
                          The original text can be
                          recovered by executing the same decryption in
                          reverse order.<span style="font-weight:

                    &nbsp;&nbsp; Before you encrypt real text, make sure
                    you go through the
                    cycle of Encryption / Decryption and get familiar
                    with the operation of
                    CryptoSticky. Be forewarned, that if you forget the
                    key or damage the
                    cipher, there is no known recovery method for your
                    original content. (Not even with supercomputers.)<br>

                    &nbsp; How secure is
                    CryptoSticky? Very. We deployed state of
                    the art encryption, with more bit combinations than
                    grains of sand in
                    the
                    universe. No key management is implemented, there
                    are no keys
                    stored, and because there are no keys anywhere,
                    there is nothing to
                    attack. (The drawback is you have to remember your
                    keys ... )<br>

                          Encryption
                          is a simple, secure, state of the art block
                          encryption algorithm. It
                          requires minimal processing power and has a
                          low memory footprint. The
                          algorithm produces an even bit distribution,
                          even when its fed with
                          small data or homogeneous content. This makes
                          it highly resilient
                          against
                          crypt analysis, and an ideal candidate where
                          safe, secure and
                          customized encryption is needed.<br>

                                  testing Bluepoint, one of the
                                  exceptional properties we
                                  found was that in the clear text

                example, when you paste cipher text into a word
                document, it can be
                edited to match the line length or the surrounding text.
                A warning here
                is in order - if you change the cipher text and modify
                even one
                significant character - your text will be unrecoverable.
