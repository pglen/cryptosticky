      <div style="text-align: left;">
      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; CryptoSticky, being a
newly developed application, is full of exciting features. The
transparency eye candy is just the tip of the iceberg. For instance,
CryptoSticky comes with a spell checker, that is 'tall dark, and
silent'.
The spell checker operates while you type, and only spell&nbsp; checks
the current line. A subtle 'squiggly' underlines the word that
CryptoSticky finds out of order. The spell checker comes with a huge
and
powerful suggestion facility. Right clicking on any word will deliver
an extensive but appropriate list.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; CryptoSticky has a network broadcast facility. For instance, one
can connect a laptop the network, start CryptoSticky, and the laptop is
ready to receive network broadcasts. Broadcasting from any computer on
the network, the laptop will receive an update of all the stickies.
Naturally, this works in the opposite direction as well. Broadcasting
from the laptop, updates all stickies on the currently running
CryptoSticky installations.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;CryptoSticky sound recording. An easy to use sound recorder and
sound editor is at the heart of the recording facility. One can edit
the sound after recording it, discarding undesired portions, unwanted
silences, or misspoken parts. The sound editor is very intuitive, one
can use it without extensive effort and learning curve.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;CryptoSticky&nbsp; Doodle. One can draw on the surface of the
sticky with a mouse. The drawing facility is simple, effective and to
the point. No more 'napkin' drawing when one has a laptop or a tablet
at hand.<br>

      <table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0"
 cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top;">&nbsp; Another exciting
feature is the Memo sharing
feature. One can connect multiple CryptoSticky instances (from
different
computers) onto a single shared directory. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;In a
larger corporation, sub entities can have their own shared
folder. For example, one folder for the 'Sales' department, one folder
for
'Purchasing'. Alternatively, folders can be assigned to teams, or
projects, and all members of the subscribers will be kept notified as
appropriate. This version of CryptoSticky can only connect to one
folder
at
any one time.<br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
CryptoSticky keeps a log of important events. To get to the log window,
open the about dialog and click on the 'Show Log' button. The
CryptoSticky
log lists (among others) 1.) Application Startup 2.) Memo Editing
events 3.)
Alarm Related Events 4.) Memo Conflicts, 5.) Memo Deletions 6.)
Application Shutdowns. CryptoSticky logs are kept on a per machine
basis
(on
local storage). The log file can be found at:
'APPDATA/CryptoSticky/activity.txt<br>

      <br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Editing conflicts.
It is possible for two people to edit
the same note. If that happens, CryptoSticky detects the situation, and
creates a sticky with a new title.The new title is an enumeration of
the original, with the suffix #1 #2 etc ... Because both the new
(edited) memo
and the old (conflicting) memo is presented to the user, allowing a
choice between the old content, new content, or&nbsp;
manual
merging of the two contents.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deletion conflicts. Memos are not deleted, rather,
they are moved to a 'Deleted' memo path. If a user deletes a memo, it
can be retrieved from the 'Deleted' folder. Naturally, memos that are
deleted from the 'Deleted' memo path are deleted permanently.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hierarchical list of memos. Most things in nature are
arranged in a tree like structure. So are memos in CryptoSticky. In
your memos, take advantage of the flexibility of the tree structure.
For example, one can create folders like 'Work' 'Play' 'Fun' 'Personal'
and arrange memos accordingly.<br>
