CryptoSticky</font><br>
      <br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; CryptoSticky has very
versatile configuration panel when it comes to customization. One can
set default memo colors,
memo
fonts. A new sticky will be created with those defaults. One can set
alarm sound duration and frequency, main window transparency, and a
host of
other options.
The 'Configure' dialog is also used to set the CryptoSticky data
folder,
the alarm sounds, and notification methods, to execute actions like
import/export memos, and
control network broadcasts of memos.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the CryptoSticky
configure panel, most every section has a 'Restore Default Settings'
button. This allows
the user to easily set the program to its default (sane) state. This
gives free
range for experimenting with fonts, colors and sounds. The main GUI
transparency is limited to 10% transparency,
to allow one to see the main panel even in case of misconfiguration.<br>

CryptoSticky
Configuration
sections:<br>
      <br>
      </span>&nbsp;1.) Memo Colors - 2.) Alarm Colors - 3.) Alarm
Sound&nbsp; - 4.)
Memo and User Interface Transparency - 5.) Memo Transparency
Timeout&nbsp; - 6.) Memo Fonts - 7.) Alarm Sound and&nbsp; System
Speaker Settings - 8.) Data Path - 9.) Notification Sound<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">1.) Memo Colors </span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Memos can have any color that the system is capable
displaying. There are two sets of colors: One for the 'Yellow memo' and
one for 'Red memo'.&nbsp; The red memo is used as a means of attention
grabber, but this is only a recommendation. By convention, the header
colors are set to color that is a shade darker than the colors on the
memo body. This color setting effects newly created memos, individual
colors can be selected for each memo.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">2.) Alarm Colors </span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Alarm Dialog can have any colors that the system is
capable
displaying.
By convention, the header colors are set
to color that is a shade darker then the colors on the memo body.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">3.) Alarm Sound </span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alarms can play any WAVE file that the system is
capable playing. CryptoSticky comes with a small set of sounds from
notification sounds to instrument sounds, percussion sounds and some
harsh sounding alarms. One is free to choose any sound that the system
can play.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">4.) Memo Transparency Timeout</span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Memos that are left on the screen without user interaction
time out, and fade to a level of transparency. This setting will
determine how long a memo has to be idle before it goes to transparent
mode. If this setting is set to zero, memos will never go to
transparent state. (essentially, memo timeouts are disabled)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">5.) Memo and User
Interface transparency </span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp; When memos are idle for a while, the transparency of the
memo changes to a more transparent state, or idle state. CryptoSticky
has fully adjustable transparencies both in normal and idle state of
the memo. While adjusting the sliders, CryptoSticky will update the
memo
transparencies in real time. The transparency settings effect only how
this computer displays memos. (tis setting is local to this computer)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">6.) Memo Fonts </span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Memos can have any fonts the system is capable
displaying. There are two different font settings. One for the memo
header, and one for the memo body. All major aspects of the font can be
changed, including font face, color, size etc ...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">7.) Alarm System Beep Settings </span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When no speaker is attached to the system, one may
miss the alarm. CryptoSticky beeps the system speaker to make sure no
alarm is missed. Naturally, it can be configured to be on or off on a
per alarm basis.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> 8.) Data Path <br>
      <br>
      </span>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the path where CryptoSticky gets its
data from. The default is the subdirectory "CryptoSticky" under the
user's 'My Documents' directory. One can choose any directory including
a network share, in which case <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>the
memos
can
be
shared
with anyone on the network.&nbsp; One special
mention
to the data path: CryptoSticky is fully network aware. If the data path
is set to a network share, CryptoSticky accesses the memo files in
'allow
read/write' share mode. This enables one to specify a shared folder on
a
network, where multiple people can see a shared set of memos and edit
them at will. Make sure that you are aware of conflict issues when
you&nbsp; access memos in the shared environment. For conflict free
access to memos see the&nbsp; 'Network Memos' section.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">8.) Notification Sound</span><br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a (shared) remote memo changes, or a memo is
created, CryptoSticky plays a notification sound. CryptoSticky can play
any
WAVE file that the system is
capable playing. CryptoSticky comes with a small set of sounds from
notification sounds to instrument sounds, percussion sounds and some
harsh sounding ones.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; From the 'Configure' panel one can initiate 'Memo Import' and
'Memo Export' as well. Please see the appropriate pages for more info.
Additionally, one can allow disallow network access to send / receive
memos on a per workstation basis. Again, please see the appropriate
pages for more info.<br>
