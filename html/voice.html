      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; Every sticky can have
its own voice recording. The built in recorder is easy to use, has
great
visual feedback and one can crop / edit / copy / cut / paste any part
of the recording with ease. It is ideal to create quick notes and
reminders. As any portion of the recording can be easily selected, cut
/ copied / pasted or deleted it becomes&nbsp; primary facility for
quick recordings. <br>
      <br>

      <div style="text-align: left;">

One
can
record
a voice memo in the edit sticky dialog by pressing the
record
key.&nbsp;&nbsp; To end your recording press the 'Record' button again,
or you
can
press 'Play' to stop recording and instantly review the recorded
material. Several segments of sound can be recorded just by&nbsp;
starting / stopping
the recording. The newly recorded segment is appended to the&nbsp; end
of
the existing one.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp; The
waveform window gives you visual feedback and allows you to edit the
wave. You can select any portion of the wave, cut / paste / crop
/delete as you see fit. <br>
            <br>
&nbsp; When recording
multiple times, the recorder appends the new wave to the end of your
previous recording. Perfect for pausing and re starting the recording,
to continue where you left off.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp; While recording, the waveform 'builds' inside the wave editor as
the buffer accumulates new sound samples. There is no limit imposed by
CryptoSticky as to the length of the recording, however it becomes
impractical to use it for more than a couple of minutes of voice
recordings.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp; Recording is done with CD quality settings, to preserve as much
of the material as technologically possible. Modern computers (and even
Net-books) are capable of storing thousands of hours of CD quality
sound.
The recorded wave is in standard wave format, that can be imported into
every program in existence. This creates the most utility value for
interoperability, without sacrificing quality.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp;The recorded wave can be edited to one's desire. Pieces can be
cut out, and augmented to contain only desired portions of the material.<br>

Any
portion
of
the
wave can be selected by clicking on the wave edit surface and dragging
the mouse. To erase the selection, double click on the wave edit
surface.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp; When clicking on the wave edit surface, the insertion point
moves to the position of the click. The insertion point is where
playback starts, or where pasted items are inserted. The wave can be
edited by right clicking on the surface of the wave editor. A context
menu shows, as displayed to the right.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp; The wave edit Right Click menu can be used to Copy / Paste waves
forms from the clipboard. The crop feature keeps the selected portion
of the waveform, allows one to augment the recording.<br>
            <br>
&nbsp; The 'Clear Buffer' command discards the whole wave, essentially
clearing the waveform for a fresh start.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The wave editor can also save your recording to any file
on your system with the 'Save as File' function. Most functions operate
on the current selection, and if nothing is selected, they assume the
whole wave is selected. The zero crossing menu item will expand the
selection to find the next zero crossing of the wave, removing the
'popping' sound on playback start and / or end. The wave editor has a
ten level undo. It undoes any editing done on the wave itself, giving
you a 'safe to experiment' work environment.<br>
