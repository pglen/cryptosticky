CryptoSticky

To make the Personal Computer personal again.

   CryptoSticky is an easy to use computer sticky application program for the PC and Net Book. It is designed to empower you for the everyday computing tasks like quickly writing something down, doodling onto the sticky pad, recording a voice memo, to encrypt stickies and share stickies across the network.

   CryptoSticky also allows one to encrypt text memos with state of the art encryption, to allow you to keep the sticky's contents secure. One can secure bank account information, passwords or site log in information, and even if the computer is stolen or compromised, the information remains safe.

  CryptoSticky's customizable look and feel, transparent user interface, seamless presence, and user friendly alarm makes this program an excellent choice for memo keeping. With a hierarchical tree of note categories, and an easy enable / disable show / hide feature for every note, CryptoSticky is a very practical  tool, and it has special features for tablet PCs. One can jot a memo down with just a couple of clicks, a life saving feature to make your computer  as useful as it can be.

Deleted stickies go through a recycler, which takes he form of a hidden folder. Deleted stickies can be recovered from this folder, appropriately named 'Deleted'.
